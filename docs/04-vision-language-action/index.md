# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action
*Cognitive Robotics Unleashed*

## Overview
This module investigates the cutting-edge intersection of AI, language, and robotics: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems. You'll master enabling robots to comprehend complex natural language commands, perceive environments through vision, and translate these into physical action sequences. We'll explore technologies like OpenAI Whisper for speech-to-text, Large Language Models (LLMs) for cognitive planning, and their integration with ROS 2 commanding humanoid robots. This module culminates in building a capstone project empowering autonomous humanoids with voice control.

## Learning Outcomes
After completing this module, you'll be able to:
- Comprehend speech-to-text processing principles for robot control.
- Integrate and utilize LLMs for high-level cognitive planning in robotics.
- Bridge the gap between human language and robot action sequences.
- Master building VLA systems for autonomous humanoid robots.
- Implement complete voice-controlled robotic systems.
